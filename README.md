## 🧭 About Me

I'm a cybersecurity specialist focused on SOC operations, threat detection, and vulnerability management. I work with SIEM platforms like Splunk and Microsoft Sentinel and tools like Nessus to investigate incidents and build detection rules. My research includes tracking how attackers weaponize public data (e.g., social media breaches) for reconnaissance and exploring AI-driven phishing detection, turning these insights into proactive defenses.

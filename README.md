<h1>Hi, I'm Lydiah!👋</h1>

- I’m currently working on: Security+ cert, an open-source SOC Playbook Simulator, and my master’s thesis.
- Learning: OSINT workflows, social media data mining, and AI-driven threat modeling for phishing attacks.
- Current read: The Age of Surveillance Capitalism
- Ask me about: OSINT tools, digital privacy, and security by design.
- Fun fact: I listen to CyberWire daily, and I never miss Hacker News or CISA’s latest alerts on Twitter.
